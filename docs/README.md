Welcome to garnbarn frontend wiki.

## Project Vision Statement
We all have an app that reminds us of a task, schoolwork, or job that we need to complete by a certain date. However, the issue is that each student in the same class gets their own work board application, and some of us forget to add work to it. As a result, they neglect to submit the task. Furthermore, the most widely used calendar program, Google Calendar, lacks versatility in this area. The “GarnBarn Board” lead in to remind users of their homework or tasks.

### Project Feature
Users must either login or create an account on the website, after which they can make a reminder by selecting a topic, tag, and expiration date. Following that, our bot will notify users every day via LINE according to the user preference.
- Show list of work and their due dates.
- Show important work that the user should do first by estimating the time that the user inputs.
- User authentication with OAuth provider (Google, LINE)
- Tag system to categorize the work. Also, allow the user to invite others to subscribe to the tag.
- Notification on available platforms for the user that subscribed on the tag or specific work.
- Users can link the LINE with the GarnBarn account. So they can receive the Notifications about the material based on their preference.
