# Vision Statement

## Background
We all have an app that reminds us of a task, schoolwork, or job that we need to complete by a certain date. However, the issue is that each student in the same class gets their own work board application, and some of us forget to add work to it. As a result, they neglect to submit the task. Furthermore, the most widely used calendar program, Google Calendar, lacks versatility in this area. The “GarnBarn Board” lead in to remind users of their homework or tasks.

## Vision
For people who want to be notified of their works, our product offers a simple way to collect their existing works from the Google Calendar and for them to add their works with its due date in our product to be notified.
